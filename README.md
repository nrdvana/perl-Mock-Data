# Mock::Data

This perl module helps you generate randomized data from patterns,
templates, or pre-defined collections.  This is mainly intended to
supply inputs for unit tests, but could have any number of uses.
The API borrows good ideas from other similar modules, but aims to
be capable of more advanced features while being just as easy to
use, and should be a good platform to extend on for project-specific
needs.

You can install the latest stable release of this module from CPAN:

    cpanm Mock::Data

or build and install this source code with the Dist::Zilla tool:

    dzil build
    cpanm ./Mock::Data-$VERSION
